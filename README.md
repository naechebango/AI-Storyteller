Title: Procedural Storytelling Game with OpenAI Prompt Engineering

Description:

Welcome to the Procedural Storytelling Game repository, a project showcasing my skills in object-oriented programming using Java and the power of OpenAI's prompt engineering and fine-tuning. This project serves as both a creative endeavor and a testament to my coding proficiency for potential employers.

Overview:

In this repository, you'll find the source code and documentation for a unique storytelling game that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's language models to create dynamically generated narratives. By combining my expertise in object-oriented programming with OpenAI's language models, this project brings a new dimension to interactive storytelling.

Key Features:

- OpenAI Integration: Harness the capabilities of OpenAI's language models to generate engaging and ever-evolving narratives. Prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques ensure a seamless blend of creativity and coherence in the storytelling.

- Object-Oriented Design: Dive into the clean and modular codebase that showcases my proficiency in object-oriented programming. The project's structure demonstrates my ability to design and implement complex systems in Java.

- Interactive Gameplay: Experience the magic of procedurally generated stories where your choices shape the narrative. Explore branching storylines, immersive worlds, and intriguing characters, all driven by intelligent algorithms.
